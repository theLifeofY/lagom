I am an incoming M.S student in mechanical engineering at OSU interested in the intersectionality of food storage, security, production, sustainability, and accessibility, mindfulness in design, especially for BIPOC communities, and farming among other things.  I am currently a MEMS R&D engineer and prior I worked at HP's 3D printing start-up division to create the first industrial color 3D printer after completing my B.S in mechanical engineering at UW.  

In my free time, I enjoy climbing and mountaineering, playing ultimate, reading, and cooking.
