In this post, I share my experience getting laid off from a large tech company right before COVID hit the US and what helped me navigate the situation.  

### How it went down:

On a sunny afternoon in February, our 3D printing president gathered the color 3D printing team, about 80 some engineers, into the auditorium. A nervous energy dominated the room.  RamÃ³n looked somber on stage, where he usually has a corporate Powerpoint queued up to share market insights, sales, and current issues with the program.  He's from Barcelona so these meetings are typically set weeks in advance, however the day before, a meeting invite for a 'Coffee Talk' was sent for the following day.  I both laughed and sighed in defeat knowing what was most likely going to happen in the meeting and because, of course, it's 2020.  My heart sunk into my stomach as I let myself internalize the reality of getting laid off.  In this job I have had the opportunity to work with brilliant, kind, and passionate engineers. That combination is rare, and among some of those colleagues, mostly white goofy dads, I found mentors and friends.  I also had the opportunity to live in Singapore for 6 months to support manufacturing and cherish all the memories I made there.  I learned the complexities of running a factory, what it means to solve all the line down issues, and create a supportive and collaborative environment between R&D and the contract manufacturer.  It wasn't all rainbows and sunshine, definitely dealt with sexist and racist instances working there, but overall, I had positive experiences. 

### Q: I got laid off, now what? 

First off, getting laid off is an overwhelming, scary, and frustrating experience no matter what the circumstances are.  Your brain kicks into high gear trying to figure out everything from putting food on the table to paying bills to finding a new job to navigating the archaic unemployment system and more.  One thing that helped me was remembering to stay true and kind to myself, and to remember that it was a decision  out of your control.  You did good work, you put in countless hours, and you helped create something meaningful whether that's technology, relationships, services, etc.  I am fortunate to say that.  In addition, getting laid off vs. fired are two very different situations.  And to be honest, I was not fully aware of the difference until it happened to me.  Getting laid off means your company does not need your job position anymore, so they do a workforce reduction (WFR).  In my case, my program was shut down so my job was not needed anymore.  Getting laid off in this scenario is not necessarily a reflection of your personal performance, it is a reflection of the company's poor performance, management, finances, etc.  The sooner you can decouple your self-worth with your job function the better.  Remember, we're all numbers and headcounts in the corporate budget. The older I get, the more I see Capitalism as the source of human suffering and COVID has only revealed the thin veil that Capitalism cast on the American people.  More on that in another post... 

### Support during a lay-off:

* Most companies offer a severance package (take it, even if it means you cannot work at the same company again, which is a BS clause)

* You qualify for unemployment!
    * Go to your workplace state's website to set up an account to file a claim
    * File a claim the Sunday after you get terminated from your job (i.e you will be paycheckless for one week in between)
* Check if you qualify for the Trade Adjustment Agreement (TAA) 
    * My program qualified for this since our jobs were being sent overseas to Barcelona (one of the approved situations)
    * If your company files for a TAA petition and it gets approved, you may be qualified to receive up to 2 years of federal funding towards an advanced degree or vocation that is deemed 'in-demand'
    * If your company has not filed for TAA, ask your HR or manager if they can file a petition for you

### Some things to do before you get officially terminated:

* Set up doctor appointments for eye, general, gynecologist, dentist, specialty doctor before your insurance ends
* Order another set of glasses or contact lens if your insurance covers it
* Get your referral appointments set up 
* Order prescriptions and medications to stock up
* Use company 'perks' (recognition points, employee discounts)
* Use that therapy assistance if offered

### Job searching during a pandemic:

Job searching during a pandemic while dealing with the emotional roller-coaster that lay-offs bring is hard.  You might feel blindsided and are dealing with so many unknowns at one time.  But if you can, find a friend or family member help you during this time: 

* Update resume and LinkedIn
* Reach out to coworkers/manager for letters of recommendation and references
* Online learning (python, CAD, AI/ML, circuits, philosophy, economics, gender studies, etc) via Lynda (free access with library card!)
* Volunteer in your community (COVID, environment, etc)
* Take time to take care of yourself (you deserve time to process and recharge)
