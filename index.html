<p>I am an incoming Master's thesis student in mechanical engineering at OSU starting Fall 2020. I want to help build a future where design, engineering, and making take into account
  sociocultural, racial, and economic factors. Think Critical Race Theory meets Engineering Solutions for the People (whether they're systemic or actual products). I am really interested in
  food storage and security, small-scale and urban agriculture, sustainability practicies, and asccessiblity for BIPOC communities. </p>  
  
 <p> I am currently a MEMS R&D engineer and prior I worked at HPâ€™s 3D printing start-up division to create the first industrial color 3D printer 
  after completing my B.S in mechanical engineering at UW.</p>
