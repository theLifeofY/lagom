<p>I am an incoming Master's thesis student in mechanical engineering at OSU starting Fall 2020. I am interested in a future where design, engineering, and making take into account
  sociocultural, racial, and economic factors. Think Critical Race Theory meets Engineering. I hope to conduct research in an interdisciplinary field such as food science technology, 
  sustainable energy solutions, and the medical fields </p>  
  
 <p> I am currently a MEMS R&D engineer and prior I worked at HPâ€™s 3D printing start-up division to create the first industrial color 3D printer 
  after completing my B.S in mechanical engineering at UW.</p>
