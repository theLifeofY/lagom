<p>I am an incoming M.S student in mechanical engineering at OSU interested in the intersectionality of food storage, security, production, 
  sustainability, and accessibility, mindfulness in design, especially for BIPOC communities, and farming among other things. 
  I am currently a MEMS R&D engineer and prior I worked at HPâ€™s 3D printing start-up division to create the first industrial color 3D printer 
  after completing my B.S in mechanical engineering at UW.</p>
