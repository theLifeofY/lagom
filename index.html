<p>I am an incoming M.S student in mechanical engineering at OSU interested in the intersectionality of food storage and security, production, 
  sustainability, and accessibility especially for BIPOC communities. I am interested in a future where design, engineering, and making take into account
  sociocultural, racial, and economic factors.  Think Critical Race Theory meets Engineering. </p>  
  
 <p> I am currently a MEMS R&D engineer and prior I worked at HPâ€™s 3D printing start-up division to create the first industrial color 3D printer 
  after completing my B.S in mechanical engineering at UW.</p>
